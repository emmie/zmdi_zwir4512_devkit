 *  This is an example to get started with ZWIR451x modules
 *
 *  The program sends packets every 5 seconds to all other devices in the
 *   network. LED2 is flashing when a packet is sent out. The receivers of
 *   the packet will signal the reception by flashing LED3 and printing a
 *   notification on UART.
 *  Besides automatic transmission of blink packet, the program demonstrates
 *   data transmission. For that, data is collected on the UART interface and
 *   sent out when a carriage return is received on the UART or when 32
 *   characters are received. LED1 is flashing when a data packet is sent out
 *   and LED4 is flashing when data is received.
